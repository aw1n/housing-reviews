The source code powering http://www.standrews-housing-reviews.com/

It was cleaned up a bit to be open sourced on Github. In particular third-party service credentials were removed from
settings files.

There are still quite a few things that are not done as I would like them to, like the fact that I wrote no tests for
this because it started just as a fun project. Some old and bad packages were also used, which I will eventually
replace with other, better libraries or implement the functionality myself.

With time more changes will be made.
